          <p class="description">Tanjirō is the eldest son of a coal seller. His entire family was massacred by a demon while he was selling coal in a town, with only his sister Nezuko surviving, but transforming into an oni.

          <p class="description">Nezuko is Tanjirō's younger sister. She was with her family when they were attacked and killed by a demon. Only she survived, but the attack left her transformed into a demon as well. However, unlike the other demons, Nezuko managed to somehow maintain her previous consciousness, which allowed her to recognize Tanjirō as her brother and not harm him. A hypnosis technique from Urokodaki caused Nezuko to see all humans as her family, which helped her become a demon that does not consume human flesh. As an alternative to not eating human flesh, Nezuko recovers from her injuries through sleep.</p>

          <h2 class="name_character">Inosuke Hashibira 嘴平伊之助 </h2>
          <p class="description">A young boy who was raised by a wild boar, Inosuke uses a self-taught style called "Breath of Beasts" (獣の呼吸法 Kemono no Kokyū-hō?), along with two serrated swords in battle. When he receives new swords, he purposely makes them serrated in order to match his preference and fighting style. He is impetuous and prone to reacting violently, and although he appears grim, he has proven himself a skilled hunter in battle time and time again. He is extremely muscular and robust, which contrasts with his strangely effeminate face, which he normally hides beneath the head of a stuffed boar. When he meets Tanjirō, he treats him as an enemy due to his determination to protect Nezuko, a demon; however, the two quickly become friends and begin to battle together. He often challenges Tanjirō to competitions accepted in good humor. He took the entrance test for the Ki-satsutai at the same time as Tanjirō and Zenitsu and was apparently the first to complete it. His katanas are violet-gray and he uses his keen sense of touch to detect enemies from long distances.</p>

          <p class="description">Zenitsu is a cowardly and fearful boy who joined the Ki-satsutai at the same time as Tanjirō. He trained and specialized in the "Thunder Breath" (雷の呼吸法 Kaminari no Kokyū-hō?) battle style through his grandfather, a veteran thunder hashira; however, Zenitsu was only able to learn the first technique (Thunder Breath has 6 techniques) and because of this, he often looks down on himself, despite the fact that he is talented, as he has always sought to perfect his skill as much as possible. first technique. Zenitsu also has excellent hearing.</p>
